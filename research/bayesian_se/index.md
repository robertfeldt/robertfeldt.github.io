# Bayesian Data Analysis for Software Engineering

Key pointers to help you get started doing Bayesian analysis on your SE data.

## ICSE 2021 Technical Briefing

We (Richard Torkar, Carlo Furia and yours truly) held a technical briefing (short tutorial) on Bayesian Data Analysis for SE at ICSE 2021 ("in" Madrid, i.e. online/virtual).

## FAQ

### Q1. Ok, BDA sounds great, but how do I get started?

We recommend you buy and read/follow the book [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Richard McElreath. We **strongly** recommend you get the 2nd edition since it involves and is based on causal analysis which will be of great importance for science (and SE) longer-term.

### Q2. What if I want a more SE-specific starting point?

You might find it useful to start with our "trifecta" of papers arguing for and providing SE-specific processes and examples:

If you find them useful and then go on to publish and use BDA in your paper we would appreciate if you cite our work.

### Q3. Where can I find examples of BDA on SE data sets?

Our papers have (re-)analyzed a few different SE-related data sets:
