# Scientific Contributions and Authorship
A PhD course. **Points**: 3 ECTS credits (adapted to student need)

## Background and Goals
The course aims to highlight, support constructive discussion of, and provide concrete methods to answer/address questions like:

* Who should be an author on your research paper and why? 
* Can we be multiple first authors on a paper? 
* Why do people get annoyed and have conflicts or, worst case, life-long feuds over authorship? 
* Alphabetical order or in order of contribution?
* What are my own patterns of contribution and how can I ensure a diversity of contributions throughout my PhD education? 

The goals are that you are aware of the many different types of contributions to science/research, that you know about authorship problems and conflicts, and that you know of specific models and methods to (try to) avoid them. A key goal is that you continously reflect on your own, "typical" contribution and how to ensure diversity and variety of contributions over your scientific career.

The course is a fluid/flexible course which is adapted to your needs and timeline as a PhD student. There are occasional seminars that relate to topics in the course but even if there are none when it best suits you the course can be adapted to your situation.

## Format
The primary format for the course is student reflection which is documented in short half-page emails when the student has submitted a paper to a venue. These emails and, optionally, short discussions around them with the course examiner, is then assembled into two rflective reports (one 6 months prior to the licentiate and one 12 months prior to the PhD defence/viva).

Infrequently, there are also seminars held at the SE division where course participants and senior faculty discuss issues related to the course. Example of seminar topics:

1. The CRediT Contributor Role Taxonomy
2. Authorship Disputes and Conflicts
3. Ethics and Morality in Scientific Crediting
4. Assessment of Research Scholars

## Examination
The course is examined based on the two reflective reports around the time of the Licentiate and PhD vivas/defences. Proof of participation (or alternatively reflection after reading relevant course materials) in relevant course seminars is also required to get the full 3 ECTS course credits.

## Eligibility
The primary focus is PhD students enrolled at the Software Engineering Division at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Chalmers | University of Gothenburg, Sweden.
